# Perceptron algorithm

This program implements binary perceptron and extends the binary perceptron for multi class classification.
Binary perceptron is used to classify between three unique classes ('class-1','class-2','class-3'). The binary
perceptron is extended using the one vs rest approach for multi-class classification. The training and testing
accuracies are computed and compared for all the scenarios. L2 regularisation is added to the multi-class classifier and
trained accordingly. The accuracies are then computed for different values of regularisation coefficient.
